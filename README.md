# DPO_CoffeClicker
The goal of the fun game Coffee Clicker, which was inspired by the popular Cookie Clicker, is to produce as many resources—in this case, coffees—as quickly as possible. 
This project was developed during the second year of the degree as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course. It was a group project with five participants.
The project follows a layered architecture and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which guarantees a distinct division between data management, business logic, and user interface. Scalability, maintainability, and long-term project evolution are all enhanced by this architectural strategy.
